									<h1 align="center">Branding Identity: Kathmandu, Nepal</h1>
									<h4 align="center">By Aitirja Chowdhury</h4>
								</header>
								<div>
									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p align="justify">This purpose of this project was to create a branding identity for an international travel company using only Adobe Illustrator.
										Through a website that randomized a series of city names, I got the city Kathmandu of Nepal, where I had to create three pieces of
										advertisments. The target audience chosen for this topic were Instagrammers that love to travel and "Gram" their adventures for
										their followers to see. All of the illustrations were done by following a design brief that was provided.
									</p>
									<br>
										<h2>Creating the Logo</h2>
										<p align="justify" margin="10px">
											<span class="image right"><img src="images/GCM130_Logo01.png" alt="" width="350px" height="350px"/></span>The first priority of this project was to come up with a logo design that was simple and represented the core idea of the destination.
											The logo shown below represents the architecture of most buildings found in Kathmandu. As it is such a relevant architecture, it was
											important to include it as part of the design so that people could quickly recognize what it represents. A personal touch was added into
											this logo, as the clients had mentioned to include initials as part of the logo design.
										</p>
										<br>
									<h2>The Three Pieces of Illustration</h2>
									<h3> 1) Postcard Illustration: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										As the postcard would be the main advertisment piece for the destination, a lot of research was done about the city of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the client wanted the postcard to be highliy illustrative, contain an adjective that is an
										aliteration of the city. As mentioned above, Kathmandu is a city that is rich with culture so to highlight that aspect of the city,
										the word "culture" was included in the postcard. However, to match with Kathmandu, it was decided to replace the letter "c" with "k".
										Another important aspect of this postcard was to include something that represented the city. The illustration on this postcard is of a
										famous temple, known as the Swayambhunath temple, is one of the oldest religious sites in Kathmandu. This temple attracts many tourists
										and so, to highlight Kathmandu's culture and heritage, the following temple was chosen to be illsutrated into the postcard.
									</p>
									<br>
										<img src="images/postcard1.jpg" alt="" width="800px" height="600px">
									</br>
									<br>
									<h3> 2) Snapchat GeoFilter: </h3>
									<p align="justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/snapchat.png" alt="" width="300" height="500px"></span>
										The next focus for advertising the destination was to create a snapchat filter which the user would use to show highlights of their adventures to
										their friends. It is seen how geofilters are very popular amongst the target audience as most of them consist of young adults. The purpose of this filter
										was for the target audience to be able to showcase their stories, hence the design for this piece was kept to a minimum. Although, important features
										were inlcuded such as the string of christmas lights which are always lined up across the downtown of Kathmandu shocasing how bright the city gets as dusk falls.
										At the same time, the national flower of the country was included as it held a cultural value amongst the people of Kathmandu.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3> 3) Web Advertisement: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										Last but not least, a web advertisement illustration was created, highlighting another beauty of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the ad is supposed to contain a slogan which would attact new clients to the travel company.
										This advertisment has a call to action that leads potential customers to know which company to contact or search for.
										The scenaries that are illustrated give the audience a view of what they could witness if they go for an adventure to Kathmandu.
										The city itself is rich with heritage and cultural values, so aspects like these are highlighted in the advertisement.

									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Through a text randomizer, various adjectives were collected, of which the word "Thicc" was randomly assigned. This purpose of this project was to
										create a comic book cover using the assigned word only with Adobe Illustrator. Every other information was collected through research on target audience.
										The search included the theme or genre that the comic would be based on and also what colour scheme would be vest fitting to work with that theme. As it
										can be seen below, the theme was cute but the genre was mystery.

							<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
							<p align="justify">I am targeting 25-34 years old people that have an average income range between
								$50,000-100,000 since they are the popular age group that buy more fine jewelry than any other age group.
							</p>
							<br>
								<img src="images/CRI300_Odette'sJewels.jpg" alt="" width="800px" height="1500px">
							</br>
							<br>
							<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								They expect to buy fine jewelry but in a price that is lower. Hence, I have included a sign for
								them to know that any purchase from the store is 50% off. I often see that stores that have an opening,
								always have sales like this and every time they have a lot of customers that come into the store to buy
								the product. As their income is usually low for this age group, they want jewelry prices to be reasonable price.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h2>How do they need/expect?</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								I am creating a theme that they could resonate with and obviously a storyline that they are aware of.
								Just like jewelry, if the advertisement holds an aesthetic where the design is simple; they are quickly
								able to get the information they need and know where to go to get their product.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>I was inspired by the collections of pictures I got from Creative Commons which gave me the idea of creating
									an advertisement poster based on the story of the Swan Lake. Thus, I wanted to create an advertisement poster
									for a jewelry store with the theme from the story.</li>
								<li>First, pictures were collected to get inspiration for the kind of content I wanted to create.</li>
								<li>Once the pictures were collected, I focused on getting information for the kind of demographic that is usually
									interested in jewelry advertisements.</li>
								<li>Then, I researched on marketing strategies that I could use to incorporate onto my poster for my selected demographic.</li>
								<li>After collecting all the valuable information, I visited some of the tutorials that were posted in the previous discussion
									segment to get an idea on how to start the editing process.</li>
								<li>I searched online for guidance towards the art style I would like to portray and the elements of design I want to incorporate.</li>
								<li>Some elements of design that I used:
									<br><ul>
										<b>• Forms – Perspective: </b>to create the depth, a large diamond was included in the background that shown to be fading away.
										<br><b>• Texture:</b> using a colorful background but the texture of the background shows hints of watercolor.
										<br><b>• Shapes – Organic/natural: </b> the diamond in the back is creating an organic geometric shapes, versus the perfectly
										round white floor under the ballerina, gives an appropriate contrast, putting the focus on the ballerina.
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Some Principles of Design were followed:
									<br><ul>
										<b>• Space</b>
										<br><b>• Hierarchy: </b>the diamond is the main focus as it is bigger compared to the ballerina.
										<br><b>• Balance: </b>putting the texts containing information about the store in both sides
										<br><b>• Dominance: </b> which is the ballerina, the logo
									</ul>
								</li>

								<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
								<p align="justify">I am targeting an audience in the ages between 18-24 years old,
									especially women who would be interested in buying perfume. This age group is referred to as
									Gen Z and they are young adults who are usually finishing high-school and are about to step
									into the real world.
								</p>
								<br>
									<img src="images/CRI300_MagicShop.jpg" alt="" width="800px" height="1225px">
								</br>
								<br>
								<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									This age group needs something that they can easily find online as they spend majority of their time on the internet.
									They are also constantly on social media as this is their source of information for the things that are happening around
									the world. Their attention span is relatively lower than of the millennials and so any information they need to know must
									be clear and concise for them to see. Also, women in this demographic are the highest consumers of perfume, so they would
									definitely be interested in these products. At the same time, they want something that is authentic and natural, hence
									information about using natural products when making perfume is essential to include in the poster, which would get them
									interested in the products that my store has to offer.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>How do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									As people in the ages between 18-24 years old tend to use social media and the internet a lot, they would definitely expect any
									store to have a website. Hence, emphasis is put on the fact that there is an online store and the website address is also given
									on the advertisement poster. Also, for easier access to the website an example QR code is incorporated onto the design so they
									can easily open the website on their phones. At the same time, this demographic also has an attention span on average of 8 seconds,
									hence information about my perfume store is kept minimal but important points are made on the poster so they get an appropriate
									amount of information. For example as mentioned before, this demographic love products that are authentic and natural. So not only
									am I mentioning the authenticity of the perfumes but also how they come at a reasonable price since this age group are newly
									graduated high-school students who wouldn’t have a stable job already.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>I am using an analogous color scheme mostly in the shades of purple and magenta as these are some of the colors that the
										Gen Z population are attracted to. When designing the bottle, I wanted to use light colors to contrast with the gradient background.
										Light colors are also signature colors used by this demographic, so including this to my design would catch their attention.
									</li>
									<li>Following design trends of 2020, I decided to use some of those trends onto my illustration. For example, I wanted to create simple
										illustrations, so that the poster is easy to read and understand. Also, another popular trend I used was 3D depth and realism to make the
										illustrations have a more realistic flow, rather than just a drawn picture on paper.
									</li>
									<li>I wanted my store name to be different from the information panel, hence I used a different font to go with the theme.
										However, in terms of information, I used a very simple font so its readable and accessible.
									</li>

								<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
								<p align="justify">I am planning to make an advertisement for a coffee shop that would open in a university campus.
									It is seen that coffee has the next big largest number of consumers after oil. Hence, if any one was to start off a coffee
									business with the right kind of advertisement towards their targeted audience which in this case are university students
									and professors, then they would make a lot of profit. However, since people in the ages of 40 and above are already the highest
									consumers of coffee, I am aiming towards the demographic that drinks less coffee compared to others, which are young adults from the ages of 18-30.
								</p>
								<br>
									<img src="images/CRI300_Brewstro.png" alt="" width="800px" height="500px">
								</br>
								<br>
								<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									Since, we are talking about an age group that is a mix of millennials and gen z, most of the advertisement is based online.
									One big design trend that everyone in this age group is obsessed with is aesthetics. Aesthetics goes a long way in history and
									definitely a valuable design concept to add for this project as the purpose is to gain customers. It is often seen that when a
									new food place opens nearby campus, students are excited to know the kinds of food the restaurant/café would be serving and most
									importantly, if the food served is instagrammable or not. At the same time, these group of people love collecting points or getting
									discounts on items that save them a lot of money. As they are the largest consumers of any product, keeping their interest in mind
									when advertising for a product would result to be profitable.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>How do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									As mentioned before, two points that I focused on was financial accessibility and aesthetic usability. In order to grab the attention
									of customers that care a lot about aesthetics and insta-worthy content, I have decided to go with a neutral color scheme which is simple
									and gives the required info instantly. At the same time, the color scheme matches with the theme of coffee. Customers would get an idea
									or expectation towards the kind of décor or the way the food would be served. The design concept was made keeping in mind how this demographic
									has a short attention span and consume information quickly. Hence, the information relayed in the advertisement is very easy to follow
									as there is minimal text which is another aspect of aesthetic design that is prominent among this demographic. The font that was used
									is Serif, so that it is readable by anyone who may be interested in knowing about a new coffee place that is about to open. Another important
									implementation to the video was the choice of audio which is very upbeat and happy. This sets the mood of the advertisement for the audience
									which would work to be beneficial since they would find the background music to be catchy and this would constantly remind them of the
									coffee shop advertisement they saw. Finally, university students don’t necessarily have a stable income, but they often have enough money
									to spend it on things that give them the opportunity to save money. So, to emphasize the profitability of buying coffee from Brewstro,
									discount prices are indicated at the end of the video which is the call to action for my intended target audience.

								<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>To get inspiration for this assignment, I had to look at YouTube videos that had examples of doing motion graphic montages.
										One of the videos was very useful to me since it gave me an idea on how to create the sequence or the montage of the different illustration I made.
									</li>
									<li>According to the video, the youtuber constantly used matte backgrounds to navigate his slides/pictures to create the montage.
										As I liked the idea and also the way he described it, I decided to follow the steps but instead of dividing my picture into
										three parts, I wanted to go with halves to keep it simple and easy for my audience to comprehend.
									</li>
									<li>I also used Adobe Illustrator many times throughout this process to create all the artworks.</li>
									<li>After researching on my intended demographic based on the topic I chose to advertise on, I started to sketch some ideas of
										the kind of content I would like to show. Starting from the logo of the store to the sequence of pictures I want the video to be about.

								<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
								<p align="justify">The target audience for this assignment are small business owners that are just starting.
									Having an online platform is so important these days and especially during these circumstances,
									having a website to launch your business is crucial. The objective of this advertisement is to help create
									websites for starting businesses and also, if need be create promotional videos for them to help advertise their work to the world.

								<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									After researching, it is seen that small business owners are usually in the age group of 40 and above and most of them are males.
									Minorities are less likely to start their own business. So, instead of creating an advertisement towards the male demographic,
									I wanted to create something that was gender neutral. Hence, neutral colours were used to help promote the starting of this new service business.
									It is also seen that colours play a big factor when advertising as they control the emotion of the viewer. So, along with an upbeat song,
									I used yellow as my prime colours to up lift the audience’s emotion and also to encourage them. Yellow is said to be the colour that
									not only brings in positivity but also used for encouragement towards something. The goal was to encourage entrepreneurs on their journey to success.

									Throughout the video, texts were kept at a minimum with a moderate readability rate. As mentioned before, colour played an important factor
									throughout the process of the video. Most of the texts were kept minimal but the colour variation would jump between white and yellow, and
									sometimes to blue to contrast with a yellow background. Yellow and white are bright colours, so they would navigate a viewer’s attention towards
									the text which would have the important information about the service business. The service business that I am advertising for has been mentioned
									both at the starting and also at the ending. It is often seen that many businesses use this tactic to not only introduce their brand but also,
									remind the viewer about the business. Introducing the business at first and then signing off with the name can work to be a reminder to the viewer
									about what the name of the business, so they can always search it up online.

								<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>There were a plethora of videos and tutorials that were inspirational towards the process of the video. Tutorials on different tricks and techniques
										for displaying a text was used. Incorporating masks to hide or even bring out a text gives these cool effects which was used a lot to make the video
										satisfying to watch. Masking the texts were used as transitional sequence throughout the process of the video.
									</li>
									<li>At first an audio clip was searched, after researching the kind of advertisement I wanted to make. I created something using only percussions as
										I wanted to add effects on texts that would change at the beat. However, it did not fit with the emotion of encouragement or inspiration of starting
										a business but rather for a theme to start something revolutionary. But towards, the end I did end up find the perfect song for my advertisement.
									</li>
									<li>Although I did find the perfect video, morphing and editing the song to fit into 20 secs was difficult. I had to cut repeating beats to make it
										shorter and even though the process was a little tedious, it was very fun. I enjoyed working through the song and made sure to include subtle fades,
										so it looked like the 3 mins long song was a whole 20 seconds long without any interruption or cuts.
									</li>
									<li>I did something different than my previous assignment which I am really proud of is the blur effect on the starting page. I have seen many intro
										scenes for videos to start of like that in my search for inspiration and I wanted to add this effect to make it flow well into the video.
									</li>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								During these times as everyone is quarantined, our day to day lives have become confined within the four walls of our room and all our school activities have moved into a virtual platform.
								At this time, students lack motivation to continue studying and start procastinating to avoid doing their work. This procastination leads to getting behind in school work and later on causes mental distress.
								</p>
							<br>
 							<h2>About the Product</h2>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/eden/eden2.png" alt="" align="center" ></span>
							<p align="justify">
								Our product <strong>Eden</strong> makes studying more engaging. This google chrome extension encourages students to focus and motivates them to complete their work.
								This extension stops a student from visiting the "forbidden" sites that are prone to distract them and keeps a track of how long they are staying focused.
								Students can set goals for themselves which would motivate them to keep studying and earn rewards for their hardwork.
								Knowledge is key and Eden is here to help students achieve their goals and excel in their studies.
								</p>
								<br>
							<h2>Target Audience</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								Eden is meant for students who need motivation to study and also for people that want to escape procastination.
							To achieve this goal, the extension is user friendly and gives the user the chance to accumulate points which they can use later to collect rewards and prizes.
							Points can only be collected if students study for a certain amount of time. Once they have reached their goal, they are free to purchase their rewards using the points they have earned.
							The prizes are selected while keeping their interests in mind so they can be further motivated to achieve their goal.</p>
								<br>
							<br>
							<h2> Points and Prizes </h2>
							<p align="justify">
								The biggest motivator of our extension is our rewards system. Once the users start the timer, our system keeps track of how long they are focused for.
								If the user studies for an hour, they receive 50 points. As they keep working through the hours, undistracted by the social media, the users collect points which they can later use to purchase some prizes.
								From changing their mouse cursors to having desktop companions, users can download their prizes onto their computers once they have purchased it using their points.
								Special prizes are given to users that have managed to collect more than 1000 points, where they get 3D printed figurines delivered to them to spice up their working space.
